Hiss Incantation Randomizer
===========================

The goal of this project is to create a system that randomizes/generates output from the Hiss Incantation
in the same way that various Lorem Ipsum generators operate. *(Model after [loremipsum.io]?)*

## Hiss Incantation?
The Hiss Incantation is a poem used in the video game [Control]. 
"[It] is a Dadaist poem that is recited by individuals possessed or influenced by the Hiss." 
This description and the transcript of the incantation both come from the [Control Fandom Wiki].

## Transcript
The following is a transcript of the Hiss Incantation as written on [Control Fandom Wiki]. 
It is also stored in [incantation.txt].

# Project Plan
| Milestone      | Description    | Issue Key / Status |
| -------------- | -------------- | :----------------: |
| User Stories   | Write up user stories describing the expected experience for each feature. | To Do |
| Framework(s)   | Determine which framework(s) must be used to achieve the desired user experience. | To Do |
| Interaction Design | Mock up any required user interfaces and document intended use-case. | To Do |
| Test Cases     | Define unit tests and other test cases to use to evaluate system behavior. | To Do |
| Alpha Test     | Evaluate basic functionality and establish proof of concept. | To Do |
| Beta Release   | Release beta version - validate full functionality. | To Do |
| Optimize Design | Identify "difficult to use" activities and optimize design to reduce difficulty. | To Do |

## User Stories
**TO DO**

*Use [Atlassian User Stories with Examples and Templates] and/or [Scaled Agile User Story] as a template and starting place.*

## Framework(s)
It will likely be easiest to implement this project as a [GitHub Pages] project. This should still 
be validated to ensure there is not another alternative that meets the project needs. To effectively 
determine which framework/platform would be best for this project, the project needs must be described in full.

### Project Needs
**TO DO**
* REST API for scripted generation
* Web Page for manual generation
